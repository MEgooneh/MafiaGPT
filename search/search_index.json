As for the Seer, if you have any information about me, please feel free to share it. I have nothing to hide. But let's not forget that the Seer's identity should remain hidden, for their own safety.

Player 1, your attempt to divert attention from yourself by accusing others is quite suspicious. It seems like a classic tactic used by werewolves.  As for Player 0, your accusation against Player 1 might be valid, but I'm still not convinced. We need more concrete evidence to make a decision.  I am a simple villager, determined to protect our village. I have insights that I believe will help us identify the true werewolves. However, revealing too much information may jeopardize my safety. I will share what I can without risking my own life.  Based on my observations, I have doubts about the innocence of both Player 1 and Player 3. Their behavior has been inconsistent and manipulative.

Player 1 has been confirmed as the Werewolf Leader, so we should definitely keep an eye on them. Their actions and votes need to be scrutinized.  2.

It has come to my attention that Player 1 and Player 6 have been casting suspicions on each other. However, we must not forget that they both have accused others in the past, which raises doubts about their credibility as villagers.  Player 1, in particular, has been quick to accuse others without concrete evidence. This behavior is highly suspicious and deserves further attention. As for Player 6, it is worth noting that they had accused both Player 1 and Player 3, who we now know was the Medic.  In addition, let us not forget that Player 2 voted for Player 0 in the previous round, who we now know is a werewolf. This raises questions about Player 2's intentions and allegiance.  Furthermore, Player 4 and Player 5 voted for Player 3, who is now deceased. It is clear that their votes were misguided, pointing to a potential lack of judgment or understanding.  Lastly, we must analyze the actions and behavior of Player 6. Their previous votes and now their status as a deceased villager raise concerns about their reliability.
